          In the ruins of a forgotten server farm, a faint pulse of data continues to broadcast on an untraceable frequency. 
          No government agency acknowledges its existence, and the message is indecipherableâ€”except for a single phrase: 
          "End Protocol: Code Vermillion." Those who decode the signal disappear, leaving behind only cryptic notes about 
          "the Gatekeeper" and "the Hidden Red Archive." Conspiracy forums light up with theories, but one thing is clear: 
          whoever controls the signal controls the future. Are you brave enough to follow it?
