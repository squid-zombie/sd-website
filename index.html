          The archive wasn’t supposed to exist. At least, that’s what we were told. 
          Yet there it was — lines of crimson code shimmering like embers on a terminal 
          older than time itself. I wasn’t the first to find it. The logs proved that. 
          Someone else had been here… and they left a message. ‘Do not decode.’
